# KRIBES — Living Overhaul Plan (Devin's brain)

**Standing order:** continue overhauling the project — server and client — toward a
real game the size of Tribes Ascend / Krunker / Narrow.One. Maximal extensibility,
cleanliness, robustness, performance, low running cost. Massive changes allowed
when research supports them. Commit per settled topic, changelog.txt one line each,
never push.

Read this file first each session. Update it as things land and as better ideas
surface. Detailed research lives in `_reports/`; this file is the current truth.

## North-star architecture

- **shared/ is the game.** Sim, combat math, wire codec, species kits, teams.
  Client renders + predicts; server validates + fans out; P2P host runs the
  same modules embedded. Any logic that exists in two languages/places is debt.
- **Rooms are matches.** (Landed 2026-09-26.) `Room` owns all per-match state;
  `GameServer` dispatches. Lobbies/matchmaking = `roomFor(name)` + a lobby API.
- **Authority split is explicit.** Server: hit claims, health/death, respawns,
  movement plausibility. Client: presentation, prediction, cosmetics.
- **Cheap to run.** Binary wire everywhere hot; delta suppression + interest
  tiers already proven (~6-8Hz effective at 20Hz tick). Every cost decision
  should survive 32 players on a $5 VPS.

## Status board

### Done
- Binary wire codec + position/tick frames, delta suppression, interest tiers
- Server validation layer + per-type rate limits + session-token reconnect
- Grace-period reconnect, idle reaper, force-send windows on knockback
- Offline play end-to-end (localAuthority, bot damage funnel, match restart)
- Modes: nuggets / ctf / dm / classic + 5v5 team bots (shared/teams.ts rules)
- P2P over WebRTC DataChannel w/ server relayed handshake + embedded authority
- Ball sim rubberband fixes: grid-locked replay, closed-form inert legs,
  renderOffset blending, settle threshold, server wall-clock catch-up
- Env-driven server config (FPS_*) + `GET /metrics` (tick lag! per-room stats)
- Room/match model groundwork — verified live (arena2 vs default isolated)
- `?room=` client param → join handshake; chat (T to open, room-scoped
  relay, rate-limited 4/s, 200-char cap, textContent rendering)
- Species instancing, AI LOD, keybinds menu, spectator fly, cloak skill,
  secondary weapons, remote-player anim overhaul, SnapshotBuffer tests
- pvptest E2E harness: --test…--test5, staleprobe, ballreplay

- Persistent identity: playerId claims are HMAC-signed (FPS_SECRET env;
  random per boot if unset). localStorage-backed on the client — names
  survive restarts and can't be stolen by id knowledge alone.
- Lag compensation: per-player 400ms position history; hitscan + AOE
  validated against target rewound by clamped shooter ping (≤250ms).
- Load spot-check: 19 players (16 orbit bots + devs) — tick lag flat at
  ~11ms avg / 29ms max, no degradation vs 3 players. Empty named rooms
  now dispose themselves (ballSim.stop + map delete; 'default' immortal).
- 35-player multi-room load test: 19 in default + 16 in loadb, ~25s
  sustained — tick lag avg 11.2ms (unchanged vs 3 players; it's this
  box's baseline setInterval drift, not load), max 36ms, 0 rejected.
  Second BallSim spun up cleanly per room. `GET /rooms` lobby listing
  + bot `--room=` flag for split-fleet tests.

### Next (audit priority order)
1. ~~Lobby UI~~ — landed: LOBBY button polls /rooms, joins via
   ?room=NAME reload, create-room input. Next polish: show own room +
   mode in the panel, mid-match room switching without reload.
2. **Movement re-sim** — shared/stepPlayer on server during validation.
   BLOCKED on JP's in-flight Player.ts edits — extract the integrator to
   shared/movement.ts when that file settles.
3. ~~Map format~~ — landed: `maps/<room>.json` (mode, ball population,
   spawn anchors, bases/objectives, bot count — all clamped with
   defaults; examples swarm/duel/nugwar/ctf). Server bots populate
   matches AND play objectives (flagGoal: grab exposed enemy flag, run
   home as carrier, return dropped own flag, defend while flag moves).
   Server-owned CTF flags landed (RoomFlags: touch pickup, drop on
   death, planar capture ring, flagUpdate broadcast); live-verified
   bot flag grabs over the wire.
   matches per spec. Next extensions: terrain ref, species mix,
   smarter bot brains (share a brain with offline bots via shared/).
4. ~~Server-owned teams/score~~ — landed: rooms assign alpha/bravo on
   join, {type:'bank'} feeds a room scoreboard, teamScore/matchEnd/
   matchStart broadcast; verified live. REMAINING seam: the client's
   nugget-pickup code must call sendBank(n) — pickup detection lives in
   JP's in-flight files.

### Later / research needed
- Client prediction + reconciliation for self (currently trust + correct).
- Demo/replay format exists partially — formalize + use for regression tests.
- Server ball sim is the pilot for server-owned creatures; generalize a
  `ServerSim` registry (deployable turrets server-side eventually).
- Voice/avatars/monetization — out of scope until core loops land.

## Non-goals
- No engine rewrite, no ECS framework, no server authoritative physics yet.
- Don't touch JP's in-flight client files (check `git status` before edits;
  the file list drifts — speciesKit/context/main/etc. have been hot).

## Working agreements (from JP, painful lessons)
- Verify myself via the E2E harness — never ask JP to confirm a fix.
- Watch `logs/client.log` (POST /client-log) for real client evidence.
- `bun --watch` does NOT reload `shared/` — server restart needed for
  shared changes; check uptime via /metrics before concluding.
- exec cwd doesn't persist — cd inside every exec; bun needs PATH export.
- `.old` soft-delete; comments explain WHY; commit per settled topic.
