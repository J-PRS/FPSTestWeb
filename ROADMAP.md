# KRIBES — Living Overhaul Plan (Devin's brain)

**Standing order:** continue overhauling the project — server and client — toward a
real game the size of Tribes Ascend / Krunker / Narrow.One. Maximal extensibility,
cleanliness, robustness, performance, low running cost. Massive changes allowed
when research supports them. Commit per settled topic, changelog.txt one line each,
never push.

Read this file first each session. Update it as things land and as better ideas
surface. Detailed research lives in `_reports/`; this file is the current truth.

## North-star architecture

- **shared/ is the game.** Sim, combat math, wire codec, species kits, teams.
  Client renders + predicts; server validates + fans out; P2P host runs the
  same modules embedded. Any logic that exists in two languages/places is debt.
- **Rooms are matches.** (Landed 2026-09-26.) `Room` owns all per-match state;
  `GameServer` dispatches. Lobbies/matchmaking = `roomFor(name)` + a lobby API.
- **Authority split is explicit.** Server: hit claims, health/death, respawns,
  movement plausibility. Client: presentation, prediction, cosmetics.
- **Cheap to run.** Binary wire everywhere hot; delta suppression + interest
  tiers already proven (~6-8Hz effective at 20Hz tick). Every cost decision
  should survive 32 players on a $5 VPS.

## Status board

### Done
- Binary wire codec + position/tick frames, delta suppression, interest tiers
- Server validation layer + per-type rate limits + session-token reconnect
- Grace-period reconnect, idle reaper, force-send windows on knockback
- Offline play end-to-end (localAuthority, bot damage funnel, match restart)
- Modes: nuggets / ctf / dm / classic + 5v5 team bots (shared/teams.ts rules)
- P2P over WebRTC DataChannel w/ server relayed handshake + embedded authority
- Ball sim rubberband fixes: grid-locked replay, closed-form inert legs,
  renderOffset blending, settle threshold, server wall-clock catch-up
- Env-driven server config (FPS_*) + `GET /metrics` (tick lag! per-room stats)
- Room/match model groundwork — verified live (arena2 vs default isolated)
- `?room=` client param → join handshake; chat (T to open, room-scoped
  relay, rate-limited 4/s, 200-char cap, textContent rendering)
- Species instancing, AI LOD, keybinds menu, spectator fly, cloak skill,
  secondary weapons, remote-player anim overhaul, SnapshotBuffer tests
- pvptest E2E harness: --test…--test5, staleprobe, ballreplay

### Next (audit priority order)
2. **Persistence** — sessionStorage identity is forgeable. Options: signed
   session tokens (HMAC, zero deps) → later real accounts. Server issues
   `{playerId, sig}` cookie/payload; reconnects + name claims get real.
3. **16-24 bot load test** — prove headroom before matchmaking exists.
   Measure /metrics tick lag + bandwidth at 16/24/32 fake players.
4. **Lag compensation** — hitscan/AOE rewind buffer (~150ms of positions per
   room). Needed before any competitive claim.
5. **Movement re-sim** — shared/stepPlayer on server during validation,
   cheap sanity (not full rollback yet).
6. **Lobby/matchmaking UI** — room list, join codes, team assignment by
   server (server owns teams/score for MP modes — client currently assigns).
7. **Map format** — declarative match definition: terrain ref, bases,
   objectives, spawn anchors, species mix. Kills "the map is the binary".
8. **Ball sim as Room resident** — done; extend to per-match species/modes.

### Later / research needed
- Client prediction + reconciliation for self (currently trust + correct).
- Demo/replay format exists partially — formalize + use for regression tests.
- Server ball sim is the pilot for server-owned creatures; generalize a
  `ServerSim` registry (deployable turrets server-side eventually).
- Voice/avatars/monetization — out of scope until core loops land.

## Non-goals
- No engine rewrite, no ECS framework, no server authoritative physics yet.
- Don't touch JP's in-flight client files (check `git status` before edits;
  the file list drifts — speciesKit/context/main/etc. have been hot).

## Working agreements (from JP, painful lessons)
- Verify myself via the E2E harness — never ask JP to confirm a fix.
- Watch `logs/client.log` (POST /client-log) for real client evidence.
- `bun --watch` does NOT reload `shared/` — server restart needed for
  shared changes; check uptime via /metrics before concluding.
- exec cwd doesn't persist — cd inside every exec; bun needs PATH export.
- `.old` soft-delete; comments explain WHY; commit per settled topic.
